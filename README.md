## Installation

The library is written in TypeScript and compiled to an UMD module to allow integration into different environments.

### Browsers

You can grab the latest version from [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/party-js@latest/bundle/party.min.js"></script>
```

The library instance is loaded into the global `party` object.

### Node.JS

If you are using a package-managed environment, you can also install the latest version via [npm].

```bash
npm install party-js
# or
yarn add party-js
```

To use it, simply `require` or `import` it.

```ts
import party from "party-js";
// or
const party = require("party-js");
```

## Usage

The library essentially offers a fully customizeable particle-system implementation into HTML documents. Users of the library have the ability to create and fine-tune effects to their individual liking. The library offers a few simple effects right out-of-the-box, so you don't have to waste time re-creating simple effects.

```js
document.querySelector(".button").addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    party.confetti(this, {
        count: party.variation.range(20, 40),
    });
});
```

## Known Issues

-   _"The particles are getting cut off inside the screen!"_  
    When creating the particle container, the library calculates the document `<body>`'s size _once_. If your document size changes during the lifetime of your application you can either:

    1. Remove the `#party-js-container`. This forces the library to re-initialize the container and will re-calculate the size. All particles will remain in memory, so nothing will be lost.
    2. Manually calculate the needed container size and update it yourself. The library does **not** do this on a per-frame basis, in order not to unvoluntarily slow down older devices with timeout polling, and watching for document size changes is an expensive task, as of writing.
